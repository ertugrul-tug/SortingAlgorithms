==================
Sorting Algorithms
==================

This is a collection of sorting algorithms implemented in Python.

The algorithms are:

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

The `main.py` file contains all the things that requaried to compare the performance of the algorithms
on a random list of integers.

The `main.py` file can be run with the following command:

    python main.py

Or you can run the `main.exe` file directly.

The libraries used in this project are:

* `math` for generating random numbers
* `time` for calculating the time taken by the algorithms
* `wxPython` for GUI
* `threading` for running the algorithms in a separate thread
* `pygame` for playing sound

The `wxPython` library is not included in the standard Python library. It can be installed using the following command:

    pip install wxPython

The `pygame` library is also not included in the standard Python library. It can be installed using the following command:

        pip install pygame

The `threading` library is included in the standard Python library.

The `math` library is included in the standard Python library.

The `time` library is included in the standard Python library.
